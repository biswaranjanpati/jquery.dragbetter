# jquery.dragbetter Changelog


## v0.1.1

**2014-03-18**

* Using a vanilla array instead of a jQuery collection enhancement (resolves
  [#1](https://github.com/lolmaus/jquery.dragbetter/issues/1),
  [#2](https://github.com/lolmaus/jquery.dragbetter/issues/2),
  [#3](https://github.com/lolmaus/jquery.dragbetter/issues/3)).
* Removed the minified version. I consider versioning autogenerated assests to be a poor practice.
  Please minify as part of your development/deployment routine.


## v0.1.0

**2014-03-17**

Initial release.
