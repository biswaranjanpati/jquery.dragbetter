# jquery.dragbetter Changelog


## v0.1.1

**2014-03-18**

* Using a vanilla array instead of a jQuery collection enhancement (resolves #1, #2, #3).
* Removed the minified version. I consider versioning autogenerated assests to be a poor practice.
  Please minify as part of your development/deployment routine.


## v0.1.0

**2014-03-17**

Initial release.
